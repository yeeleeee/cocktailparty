# Cocktail Party :tropical_drink:

This site provides a recommendation of cocktail for you! Easy to look at, fun to explore.

## Motivation and Inspirations

This all started with me(Yejin) recommending a cocktail for a friend who has never had one. After some questions ("which flavor do you like, how strong do you want it to be, etc etc") I was able to recommend the right one for her. Mengxin and Jiaojiao came up with the idea of tying this experience with data visualization. 

There were many static cocktail information visualization pieces, but we wanted to take a step further, exploring the interactive components that we could leverage to use as a visualization tool. We got inspired by pages such as [BIG Architects](http://www.big.dk/).


## Deployment
Here is our [website](https://yeeleeee.github.io/cocktailparty/).
Here is our [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t4D9fejhUf4eAOv73IeblzctNWuIp-CjsADY3CIkiBU/edit?usp=sharing)for more information.
